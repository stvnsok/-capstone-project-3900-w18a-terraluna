Week 1

In week 1 we formed a group of 4 with James, Michael and Steven who became scrum master, we decided when to have sprints and what project to start on. We decided on the recipe project. I brainstormed some user stories and came up with the technology stack we would use including using Typescript + React for the frontend and Python + Flask for the backend and Postgresql for the database. We also had a look at the problem statement and the currently available solutions to the problem presented.

Week 2
In week 2 I set up the figma file so that we can start using it to design our web application along with the user flow diagrams and flows. I also came up with the color pallete we are to use when designing the page and the user interface and interactions for logging in, signing out and validating username / password. I also brainstormed more on the user stories.

Week 3
In week 3 I set finished up a lot of designs on figma as well as created the user flow diagrams for the proposal. I created pages for most of the frontend and also helped in the creation of the schema for our database. I also suggested a wide variety of frameworks (by having done research) to use for our frontend such as Tailwind CSS.
