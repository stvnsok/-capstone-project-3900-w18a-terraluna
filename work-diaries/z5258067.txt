Week 1

In week 1 we formed a group of 4 with James, Michael and Steven who became scrum master, we decided when to have sprints and what project to start on. We decided on the recipe project. I brainstormed some user stories and came up with the technology stack we would use including using Typescript + React for the frontend and Python + Flask for the backend and Postgresql for the database. We also had a look at the problem statement and the currently available solutions  to the problem presented.
